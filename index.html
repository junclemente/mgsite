    <div><!-- About Us -->
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Back in 2007, Grace was hired as a Technician at Pacific Pathology, Inc. during her college years and met Melvin, who was training her at the job.  Melvin and Grace became friends outside of the work place, and started to hang out. At one point, he actually tried to set Grace up with another mutual friend. In the process, Melvin started having feelings and was very persistent.  Grace was not impressed but gave Melvin a chance.  She has since became impressed after 7 years of being together!</p>
